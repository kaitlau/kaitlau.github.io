document.querySelectorAll(".myDiv")
    we have to indicate the specific signifier 
    Ex: . for div 
        # for ID 
        none for a tag
is a node list, it works similarly to an array

ex: 
in the HTML
    <div class = "box"> </div>
in the Js
    let boxes = document.querySelectorAll(".box");

let palette = ["color", "color", "color"];
let opacity = 0;

for (let box of boxes) {
    box.style.backgroundColor = 
    palette[Math.floor(Math.random() *palette.lenth)];
}

This lets the divs with the class box to have random colors based on
the array

the keyword box would be a local variable because it would be contained within itself
