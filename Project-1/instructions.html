    <p>Start by cutting your pork for your Shanghai
    braised pork belly. Cut the pork belly into 3/4 
    inch thick pieces.</p>

    <p>Then bring a pot of water to a boil. Blanch 
    the pork for a couple minutes. This gets rid of 
    impurities and starts the cooking process. Take 
    the pork out of the pot and set aside.</p>

    <p>Over low heat, add oil and sugar to your wok. Melt
    the  sugar slightly and add the pork. Raise the heat
    to medium and cook until the pork is lightly browned.</p>

    <p>Turn the heat back down to low and add Shaoxing cooking wine,
    regular soy sauce, dark soy sauce, and water. It's very important
    to the color and flavor of this dish that you have both kinds of 
    soy sauce! </p>
